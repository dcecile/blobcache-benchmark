## Developing

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install a JDK (to run the Scala compiler) and [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (to download the Scala compiler and library dependencies).

### Workflow

Here are some important `sbt` commands:

- `???` (to run the benchmarks)
- `compile` (to compile everything)
- `fmt` (to reformat all source files)
